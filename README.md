# V-MICROMAKE
This is a clone of micromake suited for my home HE 3d Delta printer with comments translated to english

As Micromake seems to be based off of Marklin, but has correct pin/board setup for my HE3d delta printer, 
I figured I will use MICORMAKE version for now, untill I have time to determine all changes necessary to Markin source code necessary for my board

I'm also planning to merge some of the marlins features, for example the temperature run away detection, see details in marlin Configuration.h
